Kid Radd: KREPES (Kid Radd Existance Project Engine System)

Still work on this... this is all largely early stuff.

Meaning most of the stuff has not actually been coded yet, and is currently
just being hammered out.

Kid Radd: KREPES is now slowly moving from a 2d Platformer engine into a 
2D game framework. This mostly because I am adding a fair amount of stuff I 
kind of desire in a 2d game engine.

Current (planned) feature list:
 * Event based system (currently looking into Boost)
 * Large amount of 2d Graphic support (currently looking at Image Magick)
 * Configuration System. Should support SQLite, *.conf, *.ini and Lua based 
   configurations for Kid Radd: KREPES
 * Joystick/Keyboard Support (via perl_SDL)
 * Secure Network Code Handler
 * Raddical OAM. An extendible sprite system
 * Painful Levels. An extendible object and tile system
 * Radd Resources. A resource system that loads and caches in memory 
   the required sounds and images.
 * Over designed logging system. Generally used to make diagnosing problems 
   in code much easier. Will be able to write to text, SQLite or network.
   * the network logging system will be set up to either send to some Network 
     STDERR associated with this application, to some Bug Trac system, or 
     even to another KREPES application. Sending certain errors would make 
     great to know over a network connection between two KREPES applicatons.
     It would allow the application at the other end to know to handle it.
   * Profiling information included into the logger
   * The configuration allows for certain logging/profile to be disabled. 
     Or in some cases filter the logging.
